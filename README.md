Steps to execute:
1. Run make command in parent directory.
2. Go in build directory to run the executables.  
	a. Run server as: 1st way: "./server" ("It will take default values")  
			  2nd way: "./server" \<port_number\>  \<number_of_sets\>  \<n-way_in_set_associative_cache\>  \<num_of_threads\>  
			  
	
	b. Run client as: 1st way: Batch Mode:		"./client" ("It will take default values")  
			  2nd way: Interactive Mode:	"./client" \<server_ip\> \<port number\>  
			  3rd way: Batch Mode:		"./client" \<server_ip\> \<port number\> \<Input Request file\> \<Output Response file\>  
			  
Note: For step 2 , above given Sequence of command line parameters must be followed.


Directory Structure:
1. /build:	Contains all the excecutable files.
2. /ClientData:	Contains default request file and generated response file.
3. /include:	Contains header files.
4. /ServerData:	Contains the multiple generated csv file each for a unique set ID.
		StoreXML file when generated by toXML method in KVCache and CacheXML file when generated by dumpToFile method in KVStore.
5. /src:	Contains all the source file(Runner files for debugging).


Steps to generate XML files:
1. StoreXML.xml :	About the file:	This file collects all the data in xml format from different csv files (each for a unique set id).
			
			Steps:	a. At any point of time, after server serves request of client. 
				b. Run the executable "./kvstore" in parent directory

2. CacheXML.xml :	About the file: This file collects data of each memory cell in cache in xml format.
			Steps:	a. In "/src/server.c":  define this macro "#define PRINTCACHE 1", since "toXML" function is defined in the
				   "#ifdef" body. By default it is generating CacheXML file (MACRO is already defined).
				b. It will genrate the xml at termination of the server i.e cache values after all the clients are served.
